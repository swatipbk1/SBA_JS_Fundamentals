## Implementation of Requirements

### 1. Use of Fetch API

- Implemented fetching exchange rates from an external web API using the Fetch API.
- Implemented in `exchangeRates.js`.
- Use the Exchange Rate API Key from OAnda Corporation valid for free for 7 days.

### 2. User Interaction with API

- Created a search feature allowing users to filter currencies based on search queries.
- Implemented in `app.js`.

### 3. User Manipulation of Data within API

- Enabled users to add custom currencies through a POST request to the API.
- Implemented in `app.js`.

### 4. Use of Promises and async/await Syntax

- Utilized async/await syntax and Promises for handling asynchronous operations.
- Implemented in various functions throughout `app.js` and `exchangeRates.js`.

### 5. Organization of JavaScript Code into Modules

- Organized JavaScript code into three different module files: `exchangeRates.js`, `currencies.js`, and `app.js`.
- Imported functions and data across files as necessary.
